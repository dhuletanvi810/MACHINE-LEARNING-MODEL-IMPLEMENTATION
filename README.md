*DESCRIPTION*:
*Project Title: Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning*

As part of my internship project and to deepen my understanding of machine learning, I worked on building a predictive model for spam email detection using the *Scikit-learn* library in Python. The objective of this project was to train a model that could accurately classify emails as either *"ham" (not spam)* or *"spam"* based on the email content. Spam filtering is a common and practical application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, and it has real-world value in maintaining clean and secure email inboxes.
To start, I used a popular dataset that contains thousands of labeled email messages. Each entry in the dataset had a label (either “spam” or “ham”) and the actual message text. I began by importing the data and performing *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* to understand the distribution of classes. One of the first visualizations I created was a *bar chart* showing the class distribution. It became clear that the dataset was *imbalanced*, with more "ham" messages than "spam". This step was important to understand how the model might behave during training and evaluation.

I then performed *text preprocessing* to clean the email content. This included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating stopwords (commonly used words like "the", "and", etc., that don’t contribute much to the meaning). I also used techniques like *TF-IDF vectorization* to convert the cleaned text into numerical values that machine learning algorithms can understand.
Next, I split the dataset into *training* and *testing* sets to evaluate how well the model could generalize. I experimented with different machine learning algorithms like *Naive Bayes, **Logistic Regression, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM). After training the models, I used metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score* to evaluate their performance.
I found that *Multinomial Naive Bayes* gave a strong performance for this classification task, which is expected since it’s commonly used for text classification problems. The accuracy was impressive, and the model could detect spam messages with high precision.

One of the most interesting parts of the project was *visualizing the data* and the results. The *class distribution plot*, which shows the number of spam and ham messages, helped me understand the imbalance in the dataset and consider techniques like oversampling or using stratified sampling.
This project taught me how to handle textual data, apply machine learning models, and evaluate them effectively. It also showed me the importance of *preprocessing* and *feature extraction* in NLP tasks. I became more confident in using tools like *pandas, **matplotlib, **scikit-learn, and **seaborn* during this project.

In conclusion, working on this project gave me hands-on experience with a real-world machine learning application. It helped me improve both my *technical skills* and *problem-solving abilities*, and it was a valuable addition to my internship experience. I now feel more prepared to take on more complex machine learning challenges in the future.
